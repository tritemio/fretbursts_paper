Single-molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows probing intermolecular interactions
and conformational changes in biomacromolecules, and represents an 
invaluable tool in studying cellular processes at the molecular 
scale~\cite{Kapanidis_2006}. smFRET experiments can detect the distance between 
two fluorescent labels (\textit{donor} and \textit{acceptor}) in the 
3-10~nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free 
to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses the excitation volume, it 
emits a burst of photons, which can be detected by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. 
The intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence 
can then be related to the distance between the two fluorophores.

The analysis of smFRET experiments involves identifying photon bursts from 
single-molecules in a continuous stream of photons, estimating the 
background and other correction factors, filtering and finally extracting the corrected 
FRET efficiencies for each sub-population in the sample. In this paper we introduce FRETBursts,
a software for confocal smFRET data analysis, which 
allows executing a complete burst analysis pipeline by using state-of-the-art algorithms.
FRETBursts is an open source Python package, which we propose as both a toolkit 
for research and new developments in burst analysis, and as a reference implementation of commonly employed algorithms.
We follow the highest standard in software development to ensure that 
the source is easy to read, well documented and thoroughly tested. 
Moreover, in an effort to lower the barriers to computational reproducibility, 
we embrace a modern workflow based on Jupyter notebooks, which allows capturing the whole analysis process from reading raw data to generating publication-ready figures within a single document.
