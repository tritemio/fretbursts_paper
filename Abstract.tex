Single-molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows
probing intermolecular interactions and conformational changes in
biomacromolecules, and represents an invaluable tool for studying
cellular processes at the molecular scale. smFRET experiments can
detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor)
in the 3-10~nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry,
molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses
the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected
by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of
donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance
between the two fluorophores.

While in recent years we observed a growing number of contributions
proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis,
rarely those publications were accompanied by a software implementation.
Remarkably, given the widespread application of smFRET, no complete
software package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date.

In this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software
for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data.
FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts
analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques,
while providing an open, robust and well-documented implementation.
Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison
and development of new methods in burst analysis.

We employ modern software engineering principles in order to
minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability.
Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on
Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution.
Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the
analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can
be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes.
Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows
and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs.
By bundling in a single document analysis description, code
and results, FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows
and results encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration
among researchers in the single-molecule community.
