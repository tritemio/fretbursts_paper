\subsection{Loading the Data}
\label{sec:dataload}
While FRETBursts can load several data files formats,
we encourage users to adopt the recently introduced Photon-HDF5 file format~\cite{Ingargiola2016}.
Photon-HDF5 is an HDF5-based, open format, specifically designed for freely-diffusing smFRET and
other timestamp-based experiments.
Photon-HDF5 is a self-documented, platform- and language-independent binary format,
which supports compression and allows saving photon data (e.g. timestamps) and measurement-specific metadata
(e.g. setup and sample information, authors, provenance, etc.).
Moreover, Photon-HDF5 is designed for long-term data preservation and aims to facilitate data sharing
between different software and research groups.
All example data files provided with FRETBursts use the Photon-HDF5 format.

To load data from a Photon-HDF5 file, we use the function \verb|loader.photon_hdf5|
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/loader.html#fretbursts.loader.photon_hdf5}{link}):

\begin{lstlisting}
d = loader.photon_hdf5(filename)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
where \verb|filename| is a string containing the file path.
This command loads the measurement data into the variable \verb|d|,
a \verb|Data| object (see section~\ref{sec:data_intro}).

The same command can load data from a variety of smFRET measurements supported
by the Photon-HDF5 format, taking advantage of the rich metadata included with each file.
For instance, data generated using different excitation schemes such as CW excitation
or pulsed excitation, single-laser vs two alternating lasers, etc.,
or with any number of excitation spots, are automatically recognized and interpreted accordingly.

FRETBursts also supports loading μs-ALEX data stored in .sm files
(a custom binary format used in the Weiss lab) and
ns-ALEX data stored in .spc files (a binary format used by TCSPC Becker \& Hickl acquisition hardware).
Alternatively, these and other formats (such as ht3, a binary format used by PicoQuant hardware)
can be converted into Photon-HDF5 files using phconvert,
a file conversion library and utility for Photon-HDF5
(\href{http://photon-hdf5.github.io/phconvert/}{link}).
More information on loading different file formats
can be found in the \verb|loader| module's documentation
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/loader.html}{link}).

\subsection{Alternation Parameters}
\label{sec:alternation}

For μs-ALEX and ns-ALEX data, Photon-HDF5 normally stores parameters defining
alternation periods corresponding to donor and acceptor laser excitation.
At load time, a user can plot these parameters and change them if deemed necessary.
In μs-ALEX measurements~\cite{Kapanidis_2004},
CW laser lines are alternated on timescales of the order of 10 to 100~\us.
Plotting an histogram of timestamps modulo the alternation period, it
is possible to identify the donor and acceptor excitation periods (see figure~\ref{fig:altern_hist_double}a).
In ns-ALEX measurements~\cite{Laurence_2005},
pulsed lasers with equal repetition rates are delayed with respect
to one another with typical delays of 10 to 100~ns.
In this case, forming an histogram of TCSPC times (nanotimes) will allow
the definition of periods of fluorescence after excitation
of either the donor or the acceptor (see figure~\ref{fig:altern_hist_double}b).
In both cases, the function
\verb|plot_alternation_hist|
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plots.html#fretbursts.burst_plot.plot_alternation_hist}{link})
will plot the relevant alternation histogram (figure~\ref{fig:altern_hist_double})
using currently selected (or default) values for donor and acceptor excitation periods.
