\subsection{Theoretical foundation of burst weights}
\label{sec:burstweights_theory}
In homogenuous FRET population, burst counts in the acceptor channel can be
modeled as a binomial random variable with success probability equal to the
population PR and number of trials equal to the burst size $n_d + n_a$.
Similarly, the PR of each burst $E_i$ ($i$ being the burst index) is simply a binomial divided by the 
number of trials, therefore the variance is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:E_var}
\operatorname{Var} (E_i) = \frac{E_p\,(1 - E_p)}{n_{ti}}
\end{equation}
