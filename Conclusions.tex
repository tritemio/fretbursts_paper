\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

FRETBursts is an open source implementation of established smFRET burst analysis methods
accessible to the single-molecule community.
It implements several novel concepts which improve the analysis results, such as
time-dependent background estimation, background-dependent burst search threshold,
burst weighting and Î³-corrected burst size selection.

More importantly, FRETBursts provides a library of thoroughly-tested functions
for timestamps and burst manipulation, making it an ideal platform to
develop and compare new analytical techniques with minimal effort.

We summarize here what we consider to be the strengths
of the FRETBursts software.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open source and openly developed (see SI~\ref{sec:dev}). The source code can be inspected, 
modified and adapted for different purposes. All the software dependencies are open source as well.
\item State-of-the-art and novel algorithms for each step of the
smFRET burst analysis pipeline.
\item Modern software engineering design (e.g. DRY principle
(\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\%27t_repeat_yourself}{link})
to reduce duplication and KISS principle
(\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle}{link})
to reduce over-engineering).
\item Defensive programming~\cite{Prli__2012}: code readability,
unit and regression testing and continuous integration.
\end{enumerate}

We envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis
software as well as a platform for development and assessment of novel algorithms.
We believe that, in the single-molecule community,
a standard software implementation can enhance
reproducibility and promote a faster adoption of novel methods 
while reducing the duplication of efforts among different groups.
Finally, FRETBursts open source nature, guarantees that the source code
can always be inspected, fixed and improved
by any member of the community.

%there are a a lot of repetitions in this section. You should cut about half of it.
