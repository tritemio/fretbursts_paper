\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

FRETBursts is an open source implementation of established smFRET burst analysis methods
made available to the single-molecule community.
It implements several novel concepts which improve the analysis results, such as
time-dependent background estimation, background-dependent burst search threshold,
burst weighting and Î³-corrected burst size selection.
More importantly, FRETBursts provides a library of thoroughly-tested functions
for timestamps and burst manipulation, making it an ideal platform for
developing and comparing new analytical techniques.

FRETBursts is developed following modern software engineering practices,
such as DRY principle
(\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\%27t_repeat_yourself}{link})
to reduce duplication and KISS principle
(\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle}{link})
to reduce over-engineering. Furthermore, to minimize the number software errors,
we employ defensive programming~\cite{Prli__2012} which includes code readability,
unit and regression testing and continuous integration~\cite{Eglen_2016}.

We envision FRETBursts both as a state-of-the-art burst analysis
software as well as a platform for development and assessment of novel algorithms.
We believe that, in the single-molecule community,
standard open source software implementations, such as FRETBursts, can enhance
reliability and reproducibility of analysis and promote a faster adoption of novel methods, 
while reducing the duplication of efforts among different groups.
