\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Open Science and Reproducibility}

In the last 20 years, single molecule FRET (smFRET), has emerged as one of the most
useful techniques in single-molecule spectroscopy~\cite{Weiss_1999,Hohlbein_2014}. 
Except a few specific ensemble time-resolved measurements~\cite{Lerner_2014,Rahamim_2015}, 
smFRET unique feature is the ability to resolve conformational 
changes of biomolecules or measure binding-unbinding kinetics on heterogeneous samples. 
smFRET measurements on freely diffusing molecules (the focus of this paper) have the advantage 
of probing molecules and processes without possible perturbation from surface 
immobilization~\cite{Dahan_1999,Eggeling_1998}. 

The field of freely-diffusing smFRET data analysis, has seen a number of significant 
contributions over the 
years~\cite{Fries_1998,Eggeling_2001,Zhang_2005,Gopich_2005,Lee_2005,Nir_2006,Antonik2006,Gopich_2007,Gopich_2008,Camley_2009,Santoso_2010,Torella_2011,Tomov_2012}. 
However, so far, except for some fundamental steps of burst analysis, 
there is no single approach that is universally accepted and broadly applied. 
On one hand this situation stems from the fact that
different approaches tend to answer slightly different questions.
On the other hand, this is the result of the trade off in each research lab
between accuracy and software complexity, in particular on the amount of effort
each group wants to invest in implementing new non-trivial methods reported in literature.

In fact, except for a recent laudable example~\cite{Murphy2014}, 
each research group have reimplemented its own unpublished or closed-source versions
of the analysis software, with very little collaboration or code sharing.
Even in our group, past smFRET papers merely mention the usage of custom-made software without 
additional details~\cite{Lee_2005,Nir_2006}.
The fact that setups for freely-diffusing smFRET can significantly 
vary (in number of polarization or spectral channels for example), 
makes the problem only worst.
This situation, represents a real impediment to the scientific progress because:

(a) As new methods are proposed in literature, understandably, only few 
groups are willing (or have the resources) to invest the time necessary to 
re-implement them in their own software, especially when contributions are incremental. 
In the rare occasions of new methods being groundbreaking, the reimplementation 
requires a systematic duplication of efforts. 

(b) Both the non-availability of the software and the differences in implementation 
details render a direct comparison of different software implementations difficult, 
if not impossible. 
This limits the ability to cross-validate the correctness of different 
implementations of the same method or to compare accuracy and effectiveness
of different methods.

(c) The variety of optical setups resulted in an accumulation of different
incompatible file binary formats, some vendor-specific and some custom-made. 
This clearly represent an additional barrier in data exchange between 
groups using different hardware and aggravate the previous issues.

Effectively, these issues have created islands of non-communicating groups 
(regarding software and data sharing), in stark contrast 
with the consolidated tradition, in the biological sciences, of openly 
sharing reagents and samples.

From a more general stance, since the pioneering work of Donoho group in the 90's~\cite{Buckheit_1995}, 
became clear that developing and maintaining open source scientific software
for reproducible research is a critical requirement for progress in modern 
science~\cite{Ince_2012,Vihinen_2015}. Peer-reviewed publications describing such software are also necessary~\cite{Pradal_2013}, 
although the debate is still open on the most effective model for peer-reviewing this
class of publications~\cite{Check_Hayden_2013,Check_Hayden_2015} 
(\href{https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/04/quality-is-free-getting-there-isnt.html}{Willson 2015})
(\href{https://www.mozillascience.org/effective-code-review-for-journals}{Mills 2015})
(\href{http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-we-live-in-a-bubble.html}{Brown 2015} and \href{http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/on-code-review-of-scientific-code.html}{2013}).

Facing the previous issues, we decided to develop FRETBursts, 
an open source Python software for burst analysis of freely-diffusing
single-molecule FRET experiments. 
With FRETBursts we provide a tool that is available to any scientist
to use, study and modify. Furthermore, FRETBursts execution model 
based on Juyter Notebook~\cite{Shen_2014} is designed to facilitate 
computational reproducibility. 
FRETBursts is hosted and openly developed on GitHub~\cite{Blischak_2016,Prli__2012}, 
where users can send comments, report issues or contribute code.
In a parallel effort, some of the authors recently introduced a common
file format for timestamp-based single-molecule fluorescence experiments
called Photon-HDF5~\cite{Ingargiola2016}. The work on Photon-HDF5,
which is fully supported by FRETBursts, complements the ecosystem
of open tools for reproducible science in the single-molecule field.

Understanding smFRET burst analysis requires several concepts and definitions.
In this paper we aim to provide a brief introduction to smFRET analysis concepts
and terminology used by FRETBursts. We illustrate how to perform
the fundamental steps of burst analysis, highlighting key parameters
and algorithms available. The aim is not covering all FRETBursts
features and options but providing an overview detailed enough for starting
using FRETBursts and customizing the analysis. For additional information, 
we refer the reader to the FRETBursts Reference Documentation
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/}{link}) and to
the FRETBursts Âµs-ALEX notebook
(\href{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/FRETBursts%20-%20us-ALEX%20smFRET%20burst%20analysis.ipynb}{link})

\subsection{Paper Overview}

The paper is structured as follows.
In the next section~\ref{sec:overview} we give an overview of the software features,
the modality of execution and the development style.
In section~\ref{sec:concepts}, we
review a few preliminary concepts and terminology needed
to understand the smFRET burst analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we detail the execution the main steps involved
in smFRET burst analysis: data loading (section~\ref{sec:dataload}), defining
excitation alternation periods (section~\ref{sec:alternation}), background
correction (section~\ref{sec:bg_calc}), burst search (section~\ref{sec:burstsearch}),
burst selection (section~\ref{sec:burstsel}) and FRET fitting (section~\ref{sec:fretfit}).
The aim is to provide the reader with enough information to understand the specificities of
the different algorithms and to be able to adapt the analysis to new situations.
In section~\ref{sec:bva}, we show how to implement a new burst analysis in FRETBursts,
taking as an example the Burst Variance Analysis (BVA)~\cite{Torella_2011}.
In section~\ref{sec:dev} we describe the development process, the testing infrastructure 
and contributors guidelines.
Finally, in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}, we summarize what we believe to be
the strengths of FRETBursts software.

Throughout this paper,
links to relevant sections of documentation and other web resources
are displayed as ``(link)''.
In order to make the text accessible to the widest number of readers,
we concentrated python-specific details in special subsections titled
\textit{Python details}. These subsections provide deeper insights for readers
already familiar with python and can be safely skipped otherwise. 
Finally, note that all commands here reported can be found in the 
accompanying notebooks
