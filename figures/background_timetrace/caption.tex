\label{fig:bg_timetrace} Estimated background rate as a function of time for two Âµs-ALEX measurements. Different colors represent different photon streams. (\textit{Panel a}) A measurement performed with a sealed sample chamber exhibiting constant a background as a function of time. (\textit{Panel b}) A measurement performed on an unsealed sample exhibiting significant background variations due to sample evaporation and/or photo-bleaching (likely of impurities the cover-glass). 
These plots are produced by the command
\texttt{dplot(d, timetrace\_bg)} after estimation of background.
Each data point in these figures is computed for a 30~s time window.
