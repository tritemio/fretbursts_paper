\label{fig:alex_jointplot} \textbf{E-S histogram showing FRET, D-only and A-only populations.}
A 2-D ALEX histogram and marginal E and S histograms for a 40-bp dsDNA 
with D-A distance of 17 bases (Donor dye: ATTO550, Acceptor dye: ATTO647N). 
Bursts are selected with a size-threshold of 30 photons, including Aex photons. 
The plot is obtained with \texttt{alex\_jointplot(ds)}. The 2D E-S distribution plot (join plot)
is an histogram with hexagonal bins, which reduce the binning artifacts (compared to square bins)
and naturally resembles a scatter-plot when the burst density is low
(see SI~\ref{sec:plotting}).
Three populations are visible: FRET population (middle), D-only population (top left) and 
A-only population (bottom, $S < 0.2$). Compare with figure~\ref{fig:alex_jointplot_fretsel} 
where the FRET population has been isolated.
