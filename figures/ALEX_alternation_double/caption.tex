\textbf{Alternation histograms for μs-ALEX and ns-ALEX measurements.}
Histograms used for the selection/determination
of the alternation periods for two typical smFRET-ALEX experiments.
Distributions of photons detected by donor channel are in \textit{green}, 
and by acceptor channel in \textit{red}.
The light \textit{green} and \textit{red} shaded areas indicate the donor 
and acceptor period definitions.
(a) μs-ALEX alternation histogram, i.e. histogram of timestamps \textit{modulo} 
the alternation period for a smFRET measurement. 
(b) ns-ALEX TCSPC nanotime histogram for a smFRET measurement.
Both plots have been generated by the same plot function 
(\texttt{plot\_alternation\_hist()}).
Additional information on these specific measurements can be found in the 
attached notebook
(\href{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tritemio/fretbursts_paper/blob/master/notebooks/Figures\%20-\%20ALEX\%20histograms.ipynb}{link}).
