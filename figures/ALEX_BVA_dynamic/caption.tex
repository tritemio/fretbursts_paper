\label{fig:bva_dynamic} Left panel is an E-S histogram for single stranded DNA ($A_{31}$-TA, see in~\cite{Tsukanov_2013}), which is designed to form a hairpin structure temporarily and reversibly in the presence of 400mM NaCl. Right panel is its BVA plot. Since the transition between hairpin and open structure causes a significant change in FRET efficiency, the BVA plot shows that $s_E$, in the bridge region between two populations, sits largely above the expected standard deviation curve (\textit{red curve}).
