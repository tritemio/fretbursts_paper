\label{fig:bva_dynamic} \textbf{BVA distribution for a hairpin sample undergoing dynamics.}
The left panel shows the E-S histogram for a single stranded DNA sample ($A_{31}$-TA, see in~\cite{Tsukanov_2013}), designed to form a transient hairpin in 400mM NaCl. The right panel shows the corresponding BVA plot. Since the transition between hairpin and open structure causes a significant change in FRET efficiency, $s_E$ lies largely above the static standard deviation curve (\textit{red curve}).
