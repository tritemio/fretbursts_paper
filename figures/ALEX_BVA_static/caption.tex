\label{fig:bva_static}  \textbf{BVA distribution for a static mixture sample.}
The left panel shows the E-S histogram for a mixture of single stranded DNA (20dT) and double stranded DNA (20dT-20dA) molecules in  200 mM MgCl$_2$. The right panel shows the corresponding BVA plot. Since both 20dT and 20dT-20dA are stable and have no dynamics, the BVA plots shows $s_E$ peaks lying on the static standard deviation curve (\textit{red curve}).
