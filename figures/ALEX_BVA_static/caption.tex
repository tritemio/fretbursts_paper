\label{fig:bva_static}  Left figure is an E-S histogram for a mixture of single stranded DNA (20dT) and double stranded DNA (20dT-20dA) in the presence of 200mM MgCl$_2$. Right figure is its BVA plot. Since both 20dT and 20dT-20dA are stable and have no dynamics, the BVA plots shows an $s_E$ peak sitting on the expected standard deviation curve (\textit{red line}).
