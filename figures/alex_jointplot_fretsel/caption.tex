\label{fig:alex_jointplot_fretsel} \textbf{E-S histogram after filtering out D-only and A-only populations.}
2-D ALEX histogram after selection of FRET population 
using the composition of two burst selection filters: 
(1) selection of bursts with counts in Dex stream larger than 15;
(2) selection of bursts with counts in AexAem stream larger than 15.
Compare to figure~\ref{fig:alex_jointplot} where all burst populations 
(FRET, D-only and A-only) are reported.
