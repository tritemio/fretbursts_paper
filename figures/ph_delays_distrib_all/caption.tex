\label{fig:bg_dist_all} Experimental distributions of inter-photon delays (\textit{dots}) and
corresponding fits of the exponential tail (\textit{solid lines}).
(\textit{Panel a}) An example of inter-photon delays distribution (\textit{red dots}) and an exponential fit
of the tail of the distribution (\textit{black line}).
(\textit{Panel b}) Inter-photon delays distribution and exponential fit for different photon streams as obtained with \texttt{dplot(d, hist\_bg)}. The \textit{dots} represent the experimental histogram for the different photon streams. The \textit{solid lines} represent the corresponding exponential fit of the tail of the distributions. The legend shows abbreviations of the photon streams
and the fitted rate background rate.
