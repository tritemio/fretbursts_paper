\section{Architecture and Concepts}
\label{sec:concepts}

In this section we introduce some general concepts and naming conventions related
to smFRET burst analysis in FRETBursts.

\subsection{Photon Streams}
\label{sec:ph_streams}

The fundamental data at the core of smFRET experiments is the array of photon
arrival timestamps, with a temporal resolution set by the acquisition hardware,
ranging from below nanoseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds.
In single-spot
measurements, all timestamps are stored in a single array. In multi-spot
measurements~\cite{Ingargiola_2013}, there are as many timestamps arrays
as excitation spots.

Each array contains timestamps from both donor (D) and acceptor (A) channels.
In ALEX measurements~\cite{Lee_2005}, we can further differentiate between
photons emitted during D and A excitation periods. In FRETBursts the different
selections of photons/timestamps are called ``photon streams'' and they are
specified with a \verb|Ph_sel| object
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ph_sel.html}{link}).
In non-ALEX smFRET data there are 3 photon streams
(table~\ref{tab:ph_sel_smfret}), while in ALEX data we have 5 base photon
streams (table~\ref{tab:ph_sel_alex}).

The \verb|Ph_sel| class (\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ph_sel.html}{link})
allows the expression of any combination of photon streams.
For example, in ALEX measurements, the D-emission during A-excitation stream is
usually excluded because it does not contain any useful signal~\cite{Lee_2005}.
To indicate all but the photons in this photon stream we write
\verb|Ph_sel(Dex='DAem', Aex='Aem')|, which indicates selection of donor
and acceptor photons (\verb|DAem|) during donor excitation (\verb|Dex|) and only acceptor
photons (\verb|Aem|) during acceptor excitation (\verb|Aex|).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Photon selection  & code \\
  \hline
  All-photons       & \verb|Ph_sel('all')|\\
  D-emission    & \verb|Ph_sel(Dex='Dem')|\\
  A-emission & \verb|Ph_sel(Dex='Aem')|\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:ph_sel_smfret}Photon selection syntax (non-ALEX)}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Photon selection  & code \\
  \hline
  All-photons & \verb|Ph_sel('all')|\\
  D-emission during D-excitation & \verb|Ph_sel(Dex='Dem')|\\
  A-emission during D-excitation & \verb|Ph_sel(Dex='Aem')|\\
  D-emission during A-excitation & \verb|Ph_sel(Aex='Dem')|\\
  A-emission during A-excitation & \verb|Ph_sel(Aex='Aem')|\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:ph_sel_alex}Photon selection syntax (ALEX)}
\end{table}

\subsection{Background Definitions}
\label{sec:bg_intro}

An estimation of the background rates is needed both to select a proper threshold for
burst search and to correct the raw burst counts by subtracting the background counts.

The recorded stream of timestamps is the result of two processes: one characterized
by a high count rate, due to fluorescence photons of single molecules crossing the
excitation volume, and another one characterized by a lower count rate due to “background
counts” originating from the detectors dark counts, out of focus molecules
and sample scattering and/or auto-fluorescence\cite{Gopich_2008}.
The signature of those two processes can be
observed in the distribution of timestamp delays (i.e. the waiting times
between two subsequent timestamps) as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:bg_dist_all}(a).
The “tail” of the distribution (a straight line in semi-log scale) corresponds
to exponentially-distributed delays, indicating that those counts are generated by a
Poisson process (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process}{link}). At short
timescales, the distribution departs from exponential behavior due to the contribution
of the higher rate process of single molecules traversing the excitation volume.
To estimate the background rate, (i.e. the exponential time constant)
it is necessary to define a delay threshold, above which the distribution
can be considered exponential.
Next a fitting method, for example the Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or a curve fit of the histogram via non-linear
least squares (NLSQ) must be selected.

It is advisable to check the background at different time points
throughout the measurements in order to track possible variations.
Experimentally, we found that when the background is not constant,
it usually varies
on time scales of tens of seconds (see figure~\ref{fig:bg_timetrace}).
FRETBursts splits the data in uniform time
slices called \textit{background periods} and computes the background rates for
each of these slices (see section~\ref{sec:bg_calc}).
Note that the the same splitting in background periods is used during
burst search to compute a background-dependent
threshold and to apply the burst correction (section~\ref{sec:burstsearch}).

\subsection{The \texttt{Data} Class}
\label{sec:data_intro}

The \verb|Data| class
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html}{link})
is the fundamental data container in FRETBursts. It contains the
measurement data and parameters (attributes) as well as several methods
for data analysis (background estimation, burst search, etc...).
All analysis results (bursts data, estimated parameters) are also stored
as \verb|Data| attributes.

There are 3 important ``burst counts'' attributes which contains
the number of photon detected in donor or acceptor channel
during donor or acceptor excitation (table~\ref{tab:data_n}).
The attributes in table~\ref{tab:data_n} are background-corrected by default.
Furthermore, \verb|na| is corrected for leakage and direct excitation
(section~\ref{sec:corrcoeff}) if the relative coefficients are specified
(by default they are 0).
There is also a closely related attribute named \verb|nda| for donor photons
during acceptor excitation. \verb|nda| is normally neglected as it only contains
background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l p{0.8\columnwidth}}
  Name  & Description \\
  \hline
  \verb|nd| & number of photons detected by the donor channel (during donor excitation period in ALEX case)\\
  \verb|na| & number of photons detected by the acceptor channel (during donor excitation period in ALEX case)\\
  \verb|naa| & number of photons detected by the acceptor channel during acceptor excitation period (present only in ALEX measurements)\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:data_n}\texttt{Data} attributes names and descriptions for burst photon counts in different photon streams.}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Python details}
Many \verb|Data| attributes are list of arrays (or scalars) with list-length
equal to the number of excitation spots. This means that, in
single-spot measurements, to access an array of burst-data
we always have to specify the index 0, for example \verb|Data.nd[0]|.
\verb|Data| implements a shortcut syntax to access the first element of a list
with an underscore, so we can type equivalently use
\verb|Data.nd_| instead of \verb|Data.nd[0]|.

\subsection{Introduction to Burst Search}
\label{sec:burstsearch_intro}

Identifying single-molecule bursts in the stream of photons is
one of the most crucial steps in the analysis of freely-diffusing single-molecule FRET data.
The widely used ``sliding window'' algorithm, introduced by the Seidel group in 1998
(\cite{Eggeling_1998}, \cite{Fries_1998}), involves searching for
$m$ consecutive photons detected during a period shorter than
$\Delta t$. In other words, bursts are regions of the photon stream where the
local rate (computed using $m$ photons) is above a minimum threshold rate.
Since a universal criterion to choose the rate threshold and
the number of photons $m$ is, as of today, lacking, it has become a common
practice to manually adjust those parameters for each specific measurement.

A more general approach consists in taking into account the background rate of
the specific measurements and in choosing a rate threshold that is $F$ times
larger than the background rate. This approach assures that all the resulting bursts
have a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) larger than
$(F-1)$~\cite{Michalet_2012}. A consistent criterion for choosing the threshold is
particularly important when comparing different measurements with different background
rates, when the background significantly varies during measurements or in
multi-spot measurements where each spot has a different background rate.

A second important aspect of burst search is the choice of photon stream used
to perform the search.
In most cases, for instance when identifying FRET populations,
the burst search should use all photons (i.e. ACBS). In some other cases, when focusing on
donor-only or acceptor only populations, it is better to perform the search using
only donor or acceptor signal.
In order to handle the general case and to provide flexibility,
FRETBursts allows to perform the burst search on arbitrary selections of photons.
(see section~\ref{sec:ph_streams} for more info on photon stream definitions).

Additionally, Nir~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Nir_2006} proposed DCBS, which can help
to mitigate artifacts due to photo-physical effects such as blinking.
During DCBS, a search is performed independently on two photon streams
and bursts are marked only when both photon streams exhibit a rate higher than
the threshold, implementing a sort of AND-gate logic.
Conventionally, the term DCBS refers to a burst search where the two photon streams
are (1) all photons during donor excitation (\verb|Ph_sel(Dex='DAem')|) and
(2) acceptor channel photons during acceptor excitation (\verb|Ph_sel(Aex='Aem')|).
In FRETBursts the user can choose arbitrary photon streams as input, an in general
we call this kind of search AND-gate burst search.

After burst search, it is necessary to select
bursts having a minimum number of photons (burst size). In the most
basic form, this selection can be performed during burst search by discarding
bursts with size smaller than a threshold $L$, as originally proposed by
Eggeling~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Eggeling_1998}.
This method, however, neglects the effect
of background and γ factor on the burst size and can lead to a selection
bias of certain channels and/or sub-populations.
For this reason we suggest performing a burst size selection after background
correction, taking into account the γ factor, as discussed in
sections~\ref{sec:burstsizeweights} and~\ref{sec:burstsel}.
In special case, users can also choose to replace or combine
the burst selection based on burst size
with another criterion such as burst duration or brightness (see section~\ref{sec:burstsel}).

\subsection{$\gamma$-corrected Burst Sizes and Weights}
\label{sec:burstsizeweights}

The number of photons detected during a burst --the ``burst size''--
is computed using either all photons, or photons detected
during donor excitation period. To compute the burst size, FRETBursts uses
one of the following formulas:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:burstsize_dex}
n_{dex} = n_a + \gamma\,n_d
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:burstsize_allph}
n_t = n_a + \gamma\,n_d + n_{aa}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n_d$, $n_a$ and $n_{aa}$ are, similarly to the attributes
in table~\ref{tab:data_n}, the background-corrected
burst counts in different channels and excitation periods.
$\gamma$, called the ``γ factor'', takes into account
different quantum yields of donor and acceptor dyes and different
photon detection efficiencies between donor and acceptor detection
channels~\cite{Lee_2005}.
Eq.~\ref{eq:burstsize_dex} includes only photons during donor excitation periods,
while eq.~\ref{eq:burstsize_allph} includes all photons.
Burst sizes computed according to eq.~\ref{eq:burstsize_dex}
or~\ref{eq:burstsize_allph} are called γ-corrected burst sizes.

The burst search algorithm yields a set of bursts whose sizes
approximately follows an exponential distribution.
Bursts with large sizes (which contain most of the information)
are much less frequent than bursts with smaller sizes. For this reason, it is
important to select burst sizes larger than a threshold in order
to properly characterize FRET populations (see section~\ref{sec:burstsel}).

Selecting bursts by size is a critically important step.
A too low threshold will broaden the FRET populations and introduce
artifacts (spurious peaks and patterns) due to the majority of bursts
having E and S computed from ratios of small integers.
Conversely, a too high threshold will result in a lower number of bursts
and possibly poor statistics in representing FRET populations.
Additionally, when selecting bursts (see section~\ref{sec:burstsel}),
it is important to use γ-corrected burst sizes,
in order to avoid under-representing some FRET sub-populations
due to different quantum yields between donor and acceptor dyes and/or
different photon detection efficiencies of donor and acceptor emission.

A simple way to mitigate the dependence on the burst size threshold is
weighting bursts according to their size (i.e. their information content)
so that the bursts with largest sizes will have the largest weights.
The weighting can be used to build weighted histograms or Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) plots. When using weights, the choice of a particular
burst size threshold affects the shape of the burst distribution to a lesser extent,
therefore lower thresholds can be used (yielding to better statistics)
without broadening the peaks of sub-populations (yielding to better
population identification).

\paragraph{Python details}
FRETBursts has the option to weight bursts using γ-corrected
burst sizes which optionally include acceptor excitation photons \verb|naa|.
A weight proportional to the burst size is applied by passing the argument
\verb|weights='size'| to histogram or KDE plot functions. The \verb|weights|
keyword can be also passed to fitting functions in order to fit
the weighted E or S distributions (see section~\ref{sec:fretfit}).
Several other weighting functions (for example quadratical) are listed in the
\verb|fret_fit.get_weights| documentation
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fret_fit.html#fretbursts.fret_fit.get_weights}{link}).

\subsection{Plotting \texttt{Data}}
\label{sec:plotting}

FRETBursts uses
matplotlib~\cite{matplotlib}
and seaborn~\cite{seaborn}
to provide a wide range of built-in plot functions
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plots.html}{link})
for \verb|Data| objects.
The plot syntax is the same for both single and multi-spot measurements.
The majority of plot commands are called through the wrapper function
\verb|dplot|, for example to plot a timetrace of the photon data, type:

\begin{lstlisting}
dplot(d, timetrace)
\end{lstlisting}

The function \verb|dplot| is the generic plot function which creates figure
and handles details common to all the plotting functions (for instance the title).
\verb|d| is the \verb|Data| variable and \verb|timetrace| is the actual plot
function which operates on a single channel. In multi-spot measurements
\verb|dplot| creates one subplot for each spot and calls \verb|timetrace| for
each channel.

All built-in plot functions which can be passed to
\verb|dplot| are defined in the
\verb|burst_plot| module
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plots.html}{link}).

\paragraph{Python details}
When FRETBursts is imported, all plot functions are also imported.
To facilitate finding the plot functions through auto-completion,
their names start with a standard prefix indicating the
plot type. The prefixes are: \verb|timetrace| for binned timetraces
of photon data, \verb|ratetrace| for rates of photons as a function of time (non
binnned), \verb|hist| for functions plotting histograms and \verb|scatter| for
scatter plots.
Additional plots can be easily created directly with matplotlib.

By default, in order to speed-up batch processing, FRETBursts notebooks display plots
as static images using the \textit{inline} matplotlib backend.
User can switch to interactive figures inside the browser by activating
the interactive backend with the command \verb|%matplotlib notebook|.
Another option is displaying figures in a new standalone window
using a desktop graphical library such as QT4.
In this case the command to be used is \verb|%matplotlib qt|.

A few plot functions such as \verb|timetrace| and \verb|hist2d_alex| have interactive features
which require the QT4 backend. As an example, after switching to the QT4 backend
the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}
dplot(d, timetrace, scroll=True, bursts=True)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
will open a new window with a timetrace plot with overlay of bursts, and an horizontal scroll-bar for quick
"scrolling" throughout time. The user can click on a burst to have the corresponding burst info
be printed in the notebook.
Similarly, calling the \verb|hist2d_alex| function with the QT4 backend allows
selecting an area on the E-S histogram using the mouse.

\begin{lstlisting}
dplot(ds, hist2d_alex, gui_sel=True)
\end{lstlisting}

The values that identify the region are printed in the notebook and can be passed
to the function \verb|select_bursts.ES| to select bursts inside that region
(see section~\ref{sec:burstsel}).
